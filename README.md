# Homework6_BohdanTsynalievskyi
This project generates a list of humans, each with a name and group association, and organizes this data into a readable format. The output displays the names and number of members in each group. The project uses the `Faker` library to generate random human names and group names, with logic to assign members to random groups and print the organized results.
